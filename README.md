Implementations of several different data structures in Python. For practice!
A Linked List with the following functions:
    insert(val): Add a node with the value = val at the head of the list
    pop(): Pop and return the item at the head of the list
    size(): Return the number of elements in the list
    remove(val): Remove from the list the first node with its value = val
    search(val): Return (but do not remove) the first node with its value = val

A stack with the following functions:
    push(val): Add a node with the value = val to the top of the stack
    pop(): Remove the item at the top of the stack and return it

A queue (as a double-linked list) with the following functions:
    enqueue(val): Add a node with the value = val to the head of the queue
    dequeue(): Remove the item at the tail of the queue and return it
    size(): Return the number of nodes in the queue
